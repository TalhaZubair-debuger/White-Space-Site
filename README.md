# White-Space-Site
It is the first Front-End website I built in 2021, named White Space Site. Basically, it's a dummy portfolio website I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript a bit. It is not responsive as I wasn't familiar with building responsive designs back then. I used different icons as images and one animation over the arrow button. The javascript is just used to replace the arrow button with paragraph onClick.
Note: It will work best on resolution 1366x768
